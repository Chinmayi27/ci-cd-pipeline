Every node needs an environment setup. For the environment, compatible versions of docker and kubernetes have to be installed in every node.

Additonally, the master node needs to pod network setup. Any of the options can be picked from the below link.

#### Joining nodes to the cluster

On the master node, use the command as follows:
```
kubeadm init
```
On the worker nodes, use the join command displayed on master node:
